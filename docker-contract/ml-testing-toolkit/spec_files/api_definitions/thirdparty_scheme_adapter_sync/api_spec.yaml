      description: >
        This is a variant based on FSPIOP `PartyIdType` specification.

        Main difference being the CONSENT and THIRD_PARTY_LINK enums.


        Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.

        - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory

        Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a
        participant.

        The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the

        [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).

        Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating
        the

        international prefix.

        - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a

        participant. The format of the email should be according to the
        informational

        [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).

        - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a
        participant.

        Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth
        certificate

        number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added
        in

        the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in
        the

        PartySubIdOrType element.

        - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a
        company)

        is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in
        any

        format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill
        number

        in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.

        - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to
        a

        specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.

        For referencing a specific device under a specific business or
        organization,

        use the PartySubIdOrType element.

        - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as

        reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any
        format,

        as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.

        - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to
        a

        participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric

        characters and should be entered without whitespace.

        - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should
        be

        created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.

        Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.

        The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use
        the

        PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias
        defined

        by the PartyIdentifier.
