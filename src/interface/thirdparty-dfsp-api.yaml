            The `FSPIOP-Destination` header field is a non-HTTP standard field used by
            the API for HTTP header based routing of requests and responses to the
            destination. The field should be set by the original sender of the request
            (if known), so that any entities between the client and the server do not
            need to parse the payload for routing purposes.

                            Below are the allowed values for the enumeration.
                            - MSISDN - An MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory
                            Number, that is, the phone number) is used as reference to a participant.
                            The MSISDN identifier should be in international format according to the
                            [ITU-T E.164 standard](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/en).
                            Optionally, the MSISDN may be prefixed by a single plus sign, indicating the
                            international prefix.
                            - EMAIL - An email is used as reference to a
                            participant. The format of the email should be according to the informational
                            [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                            - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
                            Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                            number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
                            the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
                            PartySubIdOrType element.
                            - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
                            is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
                            format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                            in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                            - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                            specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
                            For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
                            use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                            - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                            reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
                            as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                            - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a
                            participant. The IBAN identifier can consist of up to 34 alphanumeric
                            characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                            - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                            created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                            Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                            The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                            PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                            by the PartyIdentifier.

            The `X-Forwarded-For` header field is an unofficially accepted standard used

            However, to this point RFC 7239 is less-used and supported than `X-Forwarded-For`.

                        currency unit; a negative value is not allowed. Using more than 18 digits
                        in the major currency unit is not allowed.

                    The API data type UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a JSON String
                    in canonical format, conforming to [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122),

                        expressed in a combined date, time and time zone format.
                        A more readable version of the format is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS[-HH:MM].

        The HTTP request `PUT /thirdpartyRequests/transactions/{id}/authorizations` is used by the auth-service to update a thirdparty authorization after successful validation.
        For an unsuccessful authorization result, the `PUT /thirdpartyRequests/transactions/{id}/authorizations/error` will be called by the auth-service, instead of this endpoint.
