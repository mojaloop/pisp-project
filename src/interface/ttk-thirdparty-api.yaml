                    The API data type DateTime is a JSON String in a lexical format that is
                    restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons.
                    The format is according to
                    [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html),
                    expressed in a combined date, time and time zone format.
                    A more readable version of the format is yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSS[-HH:MM].
                    Examples are \"2016-05-24T08:38:08.699-04:00\", \"2016-05-24T08:38:08.699Z\"
                    (where Z indicates Zulu time zone, same as UTC).

          need to parse the payload for routing purposes.

                                [RFC 3696](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696).
                                - PERSONAL_ID - A personal identifier is used as reference to a participant.
                                Examples of personal identification are passport number, birth certificate
                                number, and national registration number. The identifier number is added in
                                the PartyIdentifier element. The personal identifier type is added in the
                                PartySubIdOrType element.
                                - BUSINESS - A specific Business (for example, an organization or a company)
                                is used as reference to a participant. The BUSINESS identifier can be in any
                                format. To make a transaction connected to a specific username or bill number
                                in a Business, the PartySubIdOrType element should be used.
                                - DEVICE - A specific device (for example, a POS or ATM) ID connected to a
                                specific business or organization is used as reference to a Party.
                                For referencing a specific device under a specific business or organization,
                                use the PartySubIdOrType element.
                                - ACCOUNT_ID - A bank account number or FSP account ID should be used as
                                reference to a participant. The ACCOUNT_ID identifier can be in any format,
                                as formats can greatly differ depending on country and FSP.
                                - IBAN - A bank account number or FSP account ID is used as reference to a

                                characters and should be entered without whitespace.
                                - ALIAS An alias is used as reference to a participant. The alias should be
                                created in the FSP as an alternative reference to an account owner.
                                Another example of an alias is a username in the FSP system.
                                The ALIAS identifier can be in any format. It is also possible to use the
                                PartySubIdOrType element for identifying an account under an Alias defined
                                by the PartyIdentifier.

              description: |
                The API data type Amount is a JSON String in a canonical format that is
                restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons.
                This pattern does not allow any trailing zeroes at all, but allows an amount
                without a minor currency unit. It also only allows four digits in the minor
                currency unit; a negative value is not allowed. Using more than 18 digits
                in the major currency unit is not allowed.
              example: 123.45
          required:
            - currency

            Identifier that correlates all messages of the same sequence.
            The API data type UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a JSON String
            in canonical format, conforming to [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122),
            that is restricted by a regular expression for interoperability reasons.
            A UUID is always 36 characters long, 32 hexadecimal symbols and 4 dashes (‘-‘).
